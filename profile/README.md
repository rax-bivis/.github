## Welcome to the new Business Intelligence Git Organization.

Qlik Sense files can be found in our older, non-cloud org: https://github.rackspace.com/qlik-sense

## FAQ:
#### How can I add a new member to the organization?
- People can be invited from the [People tab in the organization menu](https://github.com/orgs/rax-bivis/people)
- Once added, they will be synced into the BI Vis Developers team and gain dev role on the next AD Group sync
  - This might take ~30 minutes at most
  - Please note they have to be in the `rpg-gbi-dev` or `tab_dev` AD groups
  
#### Is the workflow the same?
- Yes. We still use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). You will notice there is no need for merge and deletes to happen, as these are automated

#### Why use a new organization and GitHub cloud? - Why not use https://github.com/global-data-office/rax-enterprisebi?
- Our older organization does not support some CICD tools we want to start using
- The company, as a whole, is shifting to the cloud version of git and we want to avoid the confusion from double git accounts
- This organization allows us to have more control over our rules and workflows for the team
